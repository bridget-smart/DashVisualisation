# AustraliaInfluenceSampleVisualisation

A sample of the Australian Influence politics Dash visualisation. Created using Plotly / Dash.

More information about how I created the dashboard in the PDF file. 

A visualisation of the information landscape in Australia and some socioeconomic indicators. Each geographical region is a federal electorate and can be mapped to a single member of the House of Representatives. All data shown in this visualisation is simulated and does not represent real information.
        
This dashboard was made using Dash and Plotly. 
        

Future work:
- caches
- make the dashboard faster - vaex was implemented but didn't result in noticeable improvements
